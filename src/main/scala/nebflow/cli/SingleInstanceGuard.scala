/**
 * Single-instance guard (2026-08-27, hard requirement after a real
 * double-launch incident): before the gateway boots, verify nothing else is
 * already serving this port.
 *
 * The legacy PID-file guard (ProcessManager, `<dataRoot>/.pid`) only catches
 * same-home relaunches. Tonight's incident class is wider:
 *  - cross-home collisions (two `--home`s, one port) — different pid files,
 *    no guard at all today;
 *  - a lost/stale pid file (crash cleanup raced, or the first instance was
 *    started by an older build that wrote no pid);
 *  - desktop .app double-click — stdout is discarded, so the old text-only
 *    "already running" message was invisible; the user saw a silently dead
 *    second app.
 *
 * Semantics (user ruling): a second launch must NOT boot a second gateway;
 * it focuses the existing instance (open its URL — the browser IS the app
 * window until the native shell lands) or, when the port is held by a
 * foreign program, fails loudly instead of half-booting and dying at bind.
