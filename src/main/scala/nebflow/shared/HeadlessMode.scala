/**
 * NEBFLOW_HEADLESS=1 — deterministic benchmark mode, read once at JVM start.
 *
 * Benchmark containers (Terminal-Bench etc.) drive Nebflow unattended, so the
 * same task must yield the same context with no interactive waits: memory
 * blocks that persist across runs, AskUser prompts that hang forever, and
 * telemetry traffic are all benchmark noise. Each touchpoint reads this flag
 * statically — the val is frozen at object init, and the switch is
 * process-wide on purpose: a benchmark container IS headless, no per-request
 * granularity (design doc "Headless 一次性执行入口" §3.4 / §D5).
