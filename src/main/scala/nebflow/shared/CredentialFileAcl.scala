/**
 * Owner-only access control for on-disk credential files (device.json, …).
 *
 * WHY (Q2 ruling, 2026-09-11): `Files.setPosixFilePermissions` is a silent
 * no-op on Windows — the provider has no POSIX view, and the previous call
 * sites swallowed the resulting exception (`catch case _: Exception => ()`).
 * device.json therefore kept the DACL it inherited from the profile
 * directory: principals other than the current user could read the live
 * device token. This module makes the OS branch explicit and total:
 *
 *   - POSIX (macOS/Linux): mode `rw-------` — byte-identical to the previous
 *     behaviour, no change for existing installs.
 *   - Windows: the DACL is REPLACED with a single ALLOW entry for the file
 *     owner, so no inherited `Everyone` / `BUILTIN\Users` / third-party ACE
 *     survives; `icacls <file>` then lists exactly one principal.
 *
 * Scope (this batch = D6-b "narrow only"): file-mode/ACL narrowing only.
 * Credential externalisation (D6-a) and container `denyRead` are out of scope.
 *
 * Testability: macOS/Linux has no NTFS ACL view and no `icacls`, so the OS
 * enforcement sits behind [[Port]] and the branch is chosen from an
 * injectable `osName` string — branch-selection tests run on any host.
 *
 * The Windows *mechanism* was NOT executed anywhere in the original batch
 * (Q7), and that gap is exactly what shipped the missing-EA defect above;
 * `DeviceCredentialAclSpec` T3-R6 now runs it for real on a Windows host.
 * The residual is recorded in
 * sandbox-minimal-set 批 T3 证据集.
 *
 * ── 2026-09-19 (credaacl 批): the residual this file used to carry ──────────
 * `setAcl` was the WHOLE story: nothing ever proved that the ACE just written
 * leaves the owner able to open the file. On 2026-09-18 the DACL on
 * `C:\Users\Kai\.nebflow\neblink\device.json` came out as
 * `D:P(A;;0x100187;;;<owner>)` — protected, ONE owner ACE, and four bits short
 * (`FILE_READ_EA` / `FILE_WRITE_EA` / `READ_CONTROL` / `WRITE_DAC`), so
 * `java.nio`'s own `GENERIC_READ`/`GENERIC_WRITE` open — which asks for those
 * bits — was denied BY THE OWNER'S OWN ACE. The file became unreadable and
 * unwritable to the process that had just written it ("login required"
 * forever, mtime frozen), and there was NO self-healing path: the only exit
 * was an external `icacls` on the machine (kaifla-fix forensics:
 * `.nebflow/evidence/20260919_kaifla-fix/p16…p22`).
 *
 * This module now runs a ladder on the Windows branch — prove usability by a
 * REAL open ([[WindowsAcl.proveUsable]]), repair by rebuilding the file with
 * its content preserved ([[WindowsAcl.repair]]), and fail EXPLICITLY with a
 * `file:line` anchor plus the ACL mask reading when even that does not restore
 * the file ([[AclSelfLockedException]]). Everything in the ladder sits behind
 * [[WindowsAcl]], so the whole defect is reproducible — and its repair
 * verifiable — on a host without ACLs. The POSIX branch is untouched (one
 * call, same exception semantics).
